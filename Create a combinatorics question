This is the histogram of the total score of my 40 top startup cities in US datapoint. 



My question is:-

In 40 US cities what is the probability that if you selected three cities randomly from the data then at least one city is ranked in the top 10 cities.

In this question we are using combination i.e. selecting three cities randomly and probability concepts i.e. probability of at least one city being in the top 10.
